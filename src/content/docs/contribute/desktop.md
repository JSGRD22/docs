Contributing to the Zen Browser Desktop project is a great way to get involved with open-source software development. This guide will walk you through the steps to clone the project, set up your development environment, make contributions, and submit pull requests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system to clone the repository and manage your code.
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/): Required for building the browser.
- [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node package manager, which comes with Node.js.

# Building Zen Browser ðŸ“¦

We've took the time to make building Zen Browser as easy as possible, independent of your operating system or technical knowledge. 

:::danger[We cannot provide support if a build fails. Please understand this before proceeding with the following steps.]

## Step 1: Clone the Project

First, you need to clone the Zen Browser repository to your local machine. This will create a local copy of the project that you can work on.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop.git --recurse-submodules
cd desktop
```

- **`--recurse-submodules`**: This flag ensures that all submodules are cloned along with the main project. Zen Browser relies on several submodules, so this step is essential.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once you have cloned the project, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm i
```

This command will install all the packages listed in the `package.json` file, which are required for building and running Zen Browser.

## Step 3: Download and Bootstrap the Browser

To set up the browser, you need to download additional files and prepare the environment:

```bash
npm run init
```

This command handles all the necessary bootstrapping tasks, such as setting up configuration files and downloading essential resources.

## Step 4: Update Language Packs 

Before building the browser, itâ€™s recommended to update the American English language packs to ensure that all localization files are up-to-date:

```bash
sh ./scripts/update-en-US-packs.sh
```

This script updates the "en-US" localization files, which are necessary for proper language support in Zen Browser. Running this step ensures that your build includes the latest translations and language resources.

## Step 5: Build the Browser

Now that everything is set up, you can build the browser:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the source code and creates the necessary files for running Zen Browser.

## Step 6: Run the Browser

After building the browser, you can start it using:

```bash
npm start
```

This command launches the browser, allowing you to see your changes in action.

## Step 6: Making a Contribution

### Types of Contributions

You can contribute to Zen Browser in various ways, including:

- **Bug Fixes**: Identify and fix bugs in the codebase.
- **Feature Development**: Implement new features or enhance existing ones.
- **Documentation**: Improve or expand the project's documentation.
- **Code Optimization**: Refactor the code for better performance or readability.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhance the user interface or user experience.

### Guidelines for Contributions

### How to Make a Pull Request

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the Zen Browser repository on GitHub.
    
2. **Create a New Branch**: Itâ€™s a good practice to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
   
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    
3. **Make Your Changes**: Edit the code in your local repository.
    
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
   
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
    ```
    
5. **Push Your Changes**: Push your branch to your forked repository.
   
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Go to the original Zen Browser repository and submit a pull request from your forked repository.
    
    - Provide a clear title and description of your changes.
    - Reference any relevant issues in the pull request.
